## Sales microservice

I will create several models;
AutomobileVO:
-From inventory service;
-VIN

Sales Person:
-Name
-Employee Number

Potential Customer:
-Name
-Address
-Phone-number

Sale Record:
-Sales Person (Foreign Key)
-Purchasers name (Foreign Key)
-VIN (Foreign Key)
-Price of sale

From these models I will be able to use the API to create,list,delete all requirements needed by the microservice.
